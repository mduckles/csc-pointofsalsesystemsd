Implications:
	
	
Usability: the project must be usable and easy to use so that anyone can place a order 
  and see their own order to accomplish this I added plus and minus buttons for each item, 
  when there are cost options or options there are radios buttons so the one has to be picked 
  at the end they should enter there name or orders code or whatever the place wants if someone 
  came one day and ordered than the next it would replace his old order     
	
Future proofing: I will be using the module csv so when pythons update if the csv module 
  does not this program will not work but other than that this program should keep working i am 
  also using twitter bootstrap and jquery though these are a back bone in a lot of modern web apps 
  so it is unlikely that these will stop but if they did my project would not work    
	
Functionality: functionality is very important because if it doesn't work then it doesn't have any
  use as it is ment to make the jobs of workers erase the functionality. I have made sure that it 
  should work with any input as most inputs and buttons and the text one invalid charters are not 
  included when sent to flask
  
to run this you need to install flask https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/installation/ wiht a virtual enviroment 
than run main.py
